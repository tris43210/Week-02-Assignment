# Week-02-Assignment

Refelection:

Things I found easier:

- Creating the layout for the website using flexbox and centering the arrows above the image using postion relative and absoulute.

Things I learnt creting the webiste:

- Using the modular operator to create a loop on a click event that cycles through an array.
- Using the margin inline and max-width property to centre divs

Things I found diffiuclt:

- Creating the next and previous button functionality.
  - Finding a way for the buttons to incriment through the array without surpassing or going below the index number was reallllly difficult. I could not work out how to get this to link up with the thumbnail forEach function was. For example if i had selected the 2nd image on the thumbnail the next button would diplay the last image. Instead the functionality works seperate.
  - Getting the buttons to take the alt attribute too. I got the alt attribute generated when the thumbnail is clicked but the buttons since their function is seperate.
